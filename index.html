    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Securing a website is a complicated task; the world wide web is not a safe place at all, and leaving your website with vulnerabilities, can lead to unauthorized access, destruction, or modification of data. For our clients to know how to secure their websites, they should first learn what threats are on the world wide web and how they can protect their websites from them.
      One of the essentials for securing a website is to install an SSL certificate. SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer, a technology used to encrypt the connection between a web server and the browser.
      The second most important thing to mention here is passwords. Passwords are always overlooked, even though they are the gateway to your accounts and data; using obvious and easy-to-crack passwords like “12345” or “abcde1234” can lead to a data breach. 
      A good password should be lengthy and consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
      The client should also be aware of common web security threats such as cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and SQL injection. A good authorization and authentication protocol or frameworks can help prevent unauthorized access to your website.
