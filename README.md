# HTML/CSS Course Assignment

I created this website following my design in Figma. I made some minor changes to the design, such as a heading with the linear gradient on the products page; since I found that difficult to apply even though I found a solution for that online, I didn't want to add a code that I didn't understand.
I mainly used flexbox, and I think I used it a lot. And I also found out that using percentage sizing for elements, flexbox, and media queries is the best combination ever.
